## About

This package is designed to get your Unity project up and running with Stash web shop in a few easy steps. Package is wrapping Stash API endpoints and is very lightweight with no external dependencies. 

## Requirements

Stash package always targets the latest LTS version of Unity. We recommend you use the LTS version of Unity to build projects that are in production or about to ship. However, you should not encounter any issues when integrating or migrating into any other versions of Unity above the targeted release.


## Changelog

Package follows Semantic Versioning `(major.minor.patch)`. Any potential breaking changes will always cause a major version increment, non-breaking new features will cause a minor version increment, and bugfixes will cause a patch version increment.
A full version changelog is available in the [changelog](/CHANGELOG.md) file.
